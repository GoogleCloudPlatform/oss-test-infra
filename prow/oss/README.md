See [upstream prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) documentation for more detailed and generic information about what prow is and how it works.

## Upgrading Prow

Please check recent [prow announcements](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow#announcements) before updating, if you are not already familiar with them.

```shell
prow/bump.sh --auto
# commit change and merge PR
make -C prow/oss deploy
# kubectl get pods and watch for problems
# https://oss-prow.knative.dev and watch for problems
# Look at stack driver logs (go/oss-prow-debug or whatever) and look for problems)
```

### Watch pods

```console
$ watch kubectl get pods

Every 2.0s: kubectl get pods                                                                                                         Fri Aug 11 15:40:31 2017

```

### Check logs

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=deck # or the appropriate label like app=hook
# or a specific pod: kubectl logs deck-3621325446-00drl
```

## Creating a Job on Your Repo

### Github Trigger

The most common pattern is to trigger a job on some sort of Github event, esp. on PRs and on PR merges. Prow has concepts for these two specific stages. The first, running jobs on a PR, is called a presubmit job. The second, running jobs after the PR is merged, is called a postsubmit.

Both of these types of jobs can be configured using the config configmap [here](./config.yaml). In the configmap, you are configuring on which repo to run a particular job, basic metadata like the name, and then the build image. For these to be triggered, you must add `trigger` to the list of plugins in the plugins configmap [here](./plugins.yaml). For example, to add a simple presubmit to `my-repo`, requires the following edits:

```yaml
# in config.yaml
triggers:
- repos:
  - istio/istio
  - istio/test-infra
  - istio/<my-repo> # ADD THIS LINE
# ...
presubmits:
  # ...
  istio/<my-repo>: # ADD THIS BLOCK
  - name: my-repo-presubmit
    context: prow/my-repo-presubmit.sh
    always_run: true
    rerun_command: "@istio-testing test this"
    trigger: "@istio-testing test this"
    branches:
    - master
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/istio-testing/prowbazel:0.4.11
    # ...

# in plugins.yaml
my-repo: # ADD THIS BLOCK
- trigger
```

### Manually Trigger a Prow Job

```bash
# Assuming you cannot click the rerun button on deck
# and if you are oncall, do the following:
go get -u k8s.io/test-infra/prow/cmd/mkpj

mkpj --job=FOO > ~/foo.yaml # and answer interactive questions

# Contact #oncall to ensure you are approved to do the following:
kubectl --context=oss-prow create -f ~/foo.yaml
```
